# Optimized Advice for Everyone

Advice for everyone by Kevin and [Walter]((https://github.com/WalterMenjivar)


## Description
Our group is Kevin, and Walter. We created this product Optimized Advice For Everyone,
to help determine if people need a doctor or give advice of what they should do instead.
It is unlike other apps that only give you advice of what to do and do not give you a diognostic. 
Because our apps give you specific diognostic of you're symptoms and provides proffessional advice.
This app helps you determine any medical issues no matter where you are in the world and provides solutions to treat the issue.
We are passionate about this because we believe this will unlock ways in which people don't have to go see a doctor but instead be provided a solution right away if it is a minor isssue. 
For the future,we would like to develop a new feature that's able to do a
doctors job anywhere you go.
